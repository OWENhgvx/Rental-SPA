## 1. Clear and consistent layout

The app uses a simple and consistent layout with a header, navigation, and main content. Spacing and card styles stay uniform, helping users quickly understand each page.

------

## 2. Strong visual hierarchy

Important actions like “Book”, “Publish”, and “Edit” use clear button styles. Titles, text, and sections are easy to scan, guiding users to the most important information.

------

## 3. Smooth and guided user flow

Users follow a natural flow: browse listings → view details → choose dates → book.
 If a user is not logged in, the interface guides them to log in before continuing, reducing confusion.

------

## 4. Immediate and clear feedback

Loading states, errors, and success messages appear right away. Users always know what happened after an action, and form mistakes are shown directly.

------

## 5. Familiar and easy-to-use interactions

Forms follow a simple top-to-bottom structure. Cards behave the same in all pages, and buttons stay in expected positions. This makes the app easy to use without learning new patterns.
