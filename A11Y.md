This project’s accessibility work focuses on one goal: **making every screen usable for all users — with or without sight, with or without a mouse.**

------

## 1. Accessible form inputs

All inputs have built-in labels, allowing screen readers to announce fields clearly and helping users always understand what they are entering.

------

## 2. Keyboard-friendly interactions

Buttons, icons, and navigation items are fully focusable, enabling users to browse, edit, submit, and navigate without relying on a mouse.

------

## 3. Accessible images and videos

Images use `alt` text and videos include descriptive `title` attributes so that non-visual users can understand media content.

------

## 4. Clear textual feedback

Errors, loading states, and publish/unpublish results are presented as text rather than color alone, ensuring assistive tools can read them accurately.

------

## 5. Sensory and cognitive support

High contrast improves visibility for low-vision users, and guided flows (e.g., prompting unauthenticated users to log in) help reduce cognitive load and prevent user confusion.
